# License Plate Recognition Dataset
Dataset contains **88,753** high-resolution images of vehicle license plates captured across diverse real-world conditions in the Netherlands. Designed to advance research and development in **automatic license plate recognition** (ALPR), optical character recognition (**OCR**), and **intelligent traffic management systems**.

With this dataset, researchers and developers can build and refine solutions for **traffic analysis**, **transportation management**, and autonomous **vehicle technologies**. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/netherlands-license-plate-detection-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=netherlands-license-plate-dataset)**

The dataset includes a CSV file mapping image file names to corresponding plate text and country labels. Photos represent various road types, road segments, and traffic scenarios, offering a diverse foundation for training and processing OCR systems.
